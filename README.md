Personal Portfolio Project
Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio. This project was built from the ground up to showcase my skills, experience, and the projects I'm passionate about.

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You'll need Node.js (version 18.x or later is recommended) and a package manager like npm or yarn installed on your machine.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

Navigate into the project directory:

cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

Your site will now be running on http://localhost:5173. The development server supports live reloading, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected in your browser instantly.

Technologies Used
This project is built with a modern, component-based architecture using the following technologies:

Vite: A next-generation frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.

React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and custom UI development.

shadcn/ui: A collection of beautifully designed, reusable components that I've used to build out the UI.

Deployment
This Vite + React application can be easily deployed to any static site hosting service.

Recommended: Vercel
The easiest way to deploy this project is by using Vercel, the creators of Next.js.

Push your code to a public or private GitHub repository.

Sign up for a free account on Vercel and connect your GitHub account.

Import the project repository into Vercel.

Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration and set the correct build commands and output directory.

Click Deploy, and your portfolio will be live in minutes!

You can also easily connect a custom domain within the Vercel project settings.

Happy coding!
